# Overview 

When you create a real-time 3D experience (or any other experience, product, or service), it should address defined user needs based on research with your target users.
User testing and feedback is an opportunity to “reality-check” your project — against the user personas you created during pre-production, and ideally with real people who review your designs, prototypes, and the real-time 3D experience throughout the development cycle. 

# What is user testing and feedback?

The purpose of user testing is to gather qualitative and quantitative information about how well your design and its current implementation is meeting the user needs that the experience is designed to address. In other words: testing the product as an experience. 
The output of user testing is actionable feedback that you can evaluate and use to improve the experience you are creating. 
User testing isn’t a once-and-done activity. User testing must be embedded throughout the phases of production. It will ensure a high-quality final product that meets the needs of your target audience. Engaging in the user feedback process will also help you develop your skills in scoping, designing, and implementing solutions that address particular user needs.  

# Why conduct structured user testing?

Although it’s possible to get valuable information from informal feedback, user testing isn’t just putting your product in front of someone and asking what they think. It’s a structured process designed to get as much specific and useful information from the tester as possible. A coordinated approach to user testing will also enable you to collect data from a range of users, so that you can compare their responses and get a better data set to support evaluation and improvement decisions. 
Ideally, you should conduct several user tests at various stages of project design and development, whether you’re working on a professional project or a solo project to help you learn. 
You might be tempted to think, “It’s not ready yet — I’ll show this to people and get their feedback when it’s done!”  This is a natural feeling, but by the time your project is in a polished state, it’s likely you won’t be able to make big changes that the feedback might bring to light. Instead, test early and often! The more you test and refine along the way, the better your end product will be. 

# The phases of user testing

The user testing process typically follows this high level structure: 
- Define the objectives.
- Plan the session. 
- Facilitate the session.
- Evaluate the results.

# Planning for user testing

- Define the objectives
Before you prepare the questions to get feedback from users, you should determine:

- What you want to learn about your project
- What you will show the users to elicit feedback (for example, wireframes, design mock-ups, or a prototype)

You can then assess your questions and testing session plan against these objectives, to ensure that they will help you get the information you need about your project.

# Prepare the questions

Next, you’ll need to prepare the questions that will guide the user’s feedback. Depending on the type of feedback you’re looking for, you might ask open-ended questions, closed-ended questions, or a combination of both.

*Open-ended questions* give the user freedom to explain their answers. Examples include: 

- How well do you think the design/prototype/product addresses [a user need]?
- What were the moments in testing where you felt confused, and why?
- How would you improve this experience?

Although these questions can work in a survey or questionnaire, it can be more useful to ask them through a conversation. This allows you to ask follow-up questions and gain a deeper understanding of the tester’s thoughts 

*Closed-ended questions* have predetermined answers, like those found in surveys. These might include: 
- A series of statements which the user will grade their response to, for example rating confidence on a scale from 1 to 5
- Questions with simple Yes / No responses

These questions work well in a survey or questionnaire format; you don’t need to ask them yourself.

It can be helpful to use both types of questions, not only to get a variety of information, but also because some testers may find it easier to give honest critical feedback via a survey rather than to a person talking to them directly.

# Plan the testing session(s)

When you’ve defined the test questions, there are logistics to consider. You should:
- Identify the best time and date.
- Determine how to find testers from your target audience.
- Identify the ideal number of testers.
- Create an agenda for the testing session(s).
- Plan to record the session (if applicable).
- Choose a leader and note-takers for the session, if working in a team.

# Exercise: Mini product evaluation

Before you finish this tutorial, take a quick moment to put yourself in the role of a user tester. You just need an open document or a scrap of paper, to record and organize your thoughts. To do this:

1.  Choose one or two products (digital or physical) that you think are particularly well made. For example, a game or software with a particularly good user experience, or a kitchen implement that’s stylish yet functional.

2.  Try to identify why you like the product so much. Use the following questions to help you:
- What user needs does it address for you?
- What is positive about the experience for you as a user?
- How do you feel when you use it?
- How steep was the learning curve when you began to use it?
- Would you recommend it to others? Extend this answer by identifying who precisely you would recommend it to, and your reason for doing so. 

3.  This is a product that you like a lot, but take a moment to identify areas it has for improvement. Use the following questions to help you:

- Do you have relevant user needs that it does not adequately address?
- Do you have desires, rather than needs, that it does not address?
- Are there areas where the experience of using it could be refined?
- If you could say one thing to the people who designed and made the product, what would it be?

4.  Take a moment to evaluate the feedback you’ve written up for the product. If you were part of the design and development team, would this give you enough information to:

- Clearly identify the positive and negative aspects of the user’s experience of your product?
- Begin to identify possible actions that might address any user pain points?

If not, try to identify the additional questions you would ask to get that information — this will help you scope your questions when you prepare for user testing something that you’re working on!
