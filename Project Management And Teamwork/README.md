# Overview

Project management and teamwork are often referred to as “soft skills” for design and development roles. Although project management can get technical, and there are several different project management methodologies you might encounter, it primarily takes teamwork — including communication and organization skills — to be a good project manager. 

Effective project management and teamwork involves:

- Clear communication with teammates, clients, and other stakeholders
- Delivery of a final product to deadline
- A final product or output that satisfies the requirements established for the project and meets the defined goal(s)

# Phases of production

- Pre-production: The work done before full-scale production begins, such as planning, prototyping, pipeline setup, and initial designs.

- Production: Creation of the product and assets within it, including the creation of final 2D images and 3D models, audio, lighting, and user experience.

- Post-production: Work done after the final product appears to be complete, including quality assurance (QA), editing, testing, bug fixing, and final polishing.

- Operations: Ongoing work after a product has been released to keep it running, such as sales, monetization, updates, and continued maintenance.

(Properly planning for each phase of the production cycle is crucial when you need to deliver a project that is on time and works as expected.) 

# Overview of project planning

- When working on projects, you need to plan appropriate schedules, manage time, communicate, and collaborate. Even if you’re working on a project independently, it’s likely that you’ll be communicating with others at some point in the production process, especially when engaging in user testing.
Let’s explore some guidance for successfully completing and delivering projects, as an individual or member of a larger team.

- Documentation and tracking
- Documentation plays a critical role in project management. A design document acts as a single source of truth, where you can record the specific requirements for the experience that you want to create. The design document also supports producers and project managers to track design and development progress. 
- When managing projects, consistently use design documents in the following ways to guide the design and development process:
- Identify the purpose, audience, and goals of your project.
-Identify the necessary project steps by creating a project plan.
- Within the project plan, create a timeline with specific deliverables and due dates.
- Consistently track your milestones in order to produce deliverables and meet deadlines.
- Assign roles when working in teams, and define and prioritize tasks for you and all teammates.
- Make sure you and all teammates are following up and following through on roles and responsibilities.
# Time management
- Effective time management is critical to timely delivery and completion of the project. When managing projects:
- Scope time for each phase of the design and development process.
- Review your project plan daily, and give brief daily status reports to the project manager or producer (often these daily updates are called “stand-ups”).
- Use contingency planning for any unforeseen delays; reprioritize and update the tasks and deliverables in your project plans when needed.
- Identify which project planning and management tools are suitable for you or your team; when you’ve chosen them, use them consistently.
# Communication
- Without clear communication, collaboration is challenging at best - and impossible at worst. Communication is one of the most important skills for working with others in any capacity, and is vital for effective project management.
- When communicating with others on your project:
- Be clear about your progress and any issues that impact the work of others, whether they are members of your team or supporting external collaborators.
- Be respectful of others’ time — and of your own.
- When critiquing work, remain constructive and sensitive to the feelings of others. Focus on making your feedback helpful, specific, and respectful.
- Be open to feedback yourself by actively listening and engaging with the person delivering the feedback. Reflect honestly on how their feedback can be addressed. 

# Design documents and project plans

In the pre-production phase at the start of the project, design documents are created to help define and scope what you are going to create. These documents include: 
- Game (or Experience) Design Documents (GDDs)
- Target user personas
- Project charters
- Technical specifications
- Design documents
- Design documents contain the blueprint for your project. They include:
- High level overviews; for example, an overall project vision in the Game (or Experience) Design Document
- Requirements and standards for particular pipelines in the project
- Detailed design specifications for particular features

In your high level design document, you should identify:
- The goal and purpose for the project
- The intended users and audience
- Key features of the project
- The final form of delivery
- A design document can include diagrams, flow charts, sketches, inspirational images from similar products, and reference images to capture the intended look and feel of the product. 

# Preparing to publish

Quality assurance testing
During the QA testing process, there are two important project management considerations: 
- QA testing scripts and bug reporting processes. 
- Test scripts
- A QA test script is a series of steps for a tester to follow and record their observations. These scripts are usually created before formal testing starts, and are used to evaluate the product against specific project requirements and use cases. They may also be used to test the team’s assumptions about the user experience of the product.
Bug report tracking

Bug tracking and resolution is a vital part of polishing the product for delivery. The tools used to track bug reports vary — Jira and Github are popular choices, but many individuals and teams use a spreadsheet. 
Typical bug reports include: 
- Title / brief summary: A descriptive title for the bug.
- Identified frequency: How often does this bug occur (every time, most times, randomly, rarely)?
- Reproduction steps: Precise steps on how to reproduce the bug. This should be detailed enough that a developer can recreate the bug themselves without any additional information.
- Detailed description:  A more detailed summary of the bug and its impact on user experience.
Any other observations: These could include thoughts on what may be causing the bug and other relevant details (for example, “error occurs inconsistently, but more frequently at night than during the day”).
